- (5.2) How to convert String to int? String to time (commented but not explained)?
- (5.2) Why ignore the error instead of fixing it (e.g. INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)?
- (5.3) A little more on actual structure for the README could be nice.
- (5.3) Make docs from the start. Then you could add docs for each command as it goes.
