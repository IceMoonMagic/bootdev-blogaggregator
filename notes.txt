- (1.2) Don't pollute my home folder (same goes for .bootdev.yaml but at least it has an arg...)
  - As a config file, go to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config
- (1.2) Reading / Writing local files hasn't been covered, and no indication of how to do that was given
- (1.3) Manually making another command parser? It's basically the same as the Pokedex 1.4 (REPL).
- (2.1) I'm not running Postgres as a service (for this kinda thing) (initdb -D ./postgres-conf + postgres -D ./postgres-conf &)
- (2.3) time.Now not mentioned nor in spellbook?
- (5.2) How to convert String to int? String to time (commented but not explained)?
- (5.2) Why ignore the error instead of fixing it (e.g. INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)?
- (5.3) A little more on a good actual structure for the README could be nice.
- (5.3) If go is only needed for build and install, why not mention making pre-compiled binaries
  - People are way less likely to bother with something if they have to deal the dependacies like that
  - and maybe a setup script postgres
- (5.3) I feel like this should be done at the start. Then you could add docs for each command as it goes.
